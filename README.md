# WavePortal (BuildSpace tutorial)

This is a basic Hardhat project built as my first step to get into web3. The project is built following the Buildspace tutorial (Build a Web3 app with solidity). You can use [this link](https://waveportal-starter-project.aniketkumar58.repl.co/) to interact with this contract deployed on Rinkeby test network.
